- 👋 Hi, I’m @NimaBavari: software engineer, mathematician, data scientist and linguist.
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural Language Processing; ORMs; algorithms for extrema (e.g., shortest, slowest, fastest).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to take better care of my health.
- :sunflower: My current average vibrational frequency is 290Hz.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [EnORM](https://github.com/NimaBavari/EnORM).
- 📫 You can reach me via <nima.bavari@gmail.com> about anything 😀.
